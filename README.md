👋 Hi, I’m Akhil
I’m an IT Product Manager & Product Owner 🧭 who believes in Vibe Coding ⚡ — move fast, stay grounded, ship things that work in the real world.
I’ve led successful production deployments, including LMVFS.in 🏦 — a web-based CRM for financial services.
I owned the product end-to-end 🔁: requirements 📋, architecture 🏗️, delivery 🚢, and iteration 🔧 in live environments.

🛠️ What I Build With
lovable.dev 💖 for rapid UI and workflow execution
Supabase 🧠 (Database 🗄️, Edge Functions ⚙️, Auth 🔐, Third-party integrations 🔌)
SaaS systems that favor reliability 🪨 over buzzwords ✂️

🎯 How I Work
Clear ownership, fewer meetings
Practical engineering over theory
Shipping > slide decks
GitHub is where I document real builds 🧩, experiments 🧪, and production-ready patterns 🧱 — not demo-ware.
